# Tutorial_Lesson_Unity2D_Adding_Explosive_Force
 Using Explosive Force In Unity2d  With Raycasting 

This is a project for a tutorial on my YouTube Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydKq4MoFcHMA99KVx-FBOQ 
I currently do not have a voice but had said this would be uploaded today, so its up and public and a video will come breaking it all down in a few days 


in this project we create a script to throw snack foods out of a vending machine when clicked on using two different methods, one being raycasting to specific layers and another as a call to the script itself on a ondown method

this tutorial includes instatiation of objects with a foreach loop and grabbing the objects from a array, as well as briefly how to use the partical system
