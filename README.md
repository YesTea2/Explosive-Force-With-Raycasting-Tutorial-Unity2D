This is a project for a tutorial on my YouTube Channel

The video for this project is not online yet - 


in this project we create a script to throw snack foods out of a vending machine when clicked on using two different methods, one being raycasting to specific layers and another as a call to the script using a button press

this tutorial includes instantiation of objects with a for-each loop and grabbing the objects from an array, as well as briefly how to use the particle system
